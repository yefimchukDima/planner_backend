# Planner Backend Project Documentation

## Introduction

This project is a Nest.js-based backend application designed to serve as the server-side component for a specific purpose. It includes a PostgreSQL database configuration and Docker Compose setup to easily manage the database.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the terminal.

### Database Setup

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following content:

   ```
   PORT=8080
   POSTGRES_PORT=5432
   DB_TYPE=postgres
   POSTGRES_USER=your_postgres_username
   POSTGRES_DATABASE=your_database_name
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   POSTGRES_HOST=db
   TYPEORM_SYNC=true
   ```

   Replace `your_postgres_username`, `your_database_name`, and `your_database_password` with your desired values.

### Docker Compose Setup

4. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of your project with the following content:

   ```yaml
   version: '3'
   
   services:
     db:
       image: postgres:latest
       container_name: postgres_db
       environment:
         POSTGRES_USER: your_postgres_username
         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: your_database_password
         POSTGRES_DB: your_database_name
       ports:
         - "1234:5432"
   
   ```
   Replace `your_postgres_username`, `your_database_name`, and `your_database_password` with the same values used in the `.env` file.

### Starting the Application and Database

5. Run the following command to start the database and the Nest.js application:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

6. Next, run the following command to install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

7. Finally, start the Nest.js application:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
